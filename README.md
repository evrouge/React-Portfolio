# React Portfolio

## Technologies used:
- React and Bootstrap for React

## About the project:
- I created my portfolio website as a way to let others know about myself, my skills, and the projects that I have done all in one place! On this site you will see a section for my bio, my technical skills that I have learned over the last year, the projects that I have done, and my resume is here as well! You can click each link in the nav bar and it will scroll down to that section!

- In the About me section you will learn about my background as well as my hobbies.

- In the technical skills section I have added dev icons to show what skills I have learned over the last year.

- In the project section, I used Bootstrap cards to show my projects. There is a photo of the project itself, with a short description of the technologies used, and I also have links provided for the websites, as well as links to each GitHub repo.

- In the resume section you will find a copy of my resume that you can download!

- At the very bottom of the page there is a contact form Bootstrap modal that is not working yet, but will be soon!
